# HALytics-Hub

**HALytics-Hub** is the central web server and visualization platform for the HALytics (Hook and Line Analytics Monitoring System) project. It receives real-time telemetry data from HALytics, which consists of an ESP32 microcontroller equipped with force and pressure sensors, simulating mechanical forces during landmine neutralization procedures.

The server exposes an API endpoint for the ESP32 to post sensor data, and hosts a live web dashboard for users to monitor incoming readings, view trends, and analyze safety-critical metrics in real time. This system is designed to support field testing, research, and safety evaluation of the HAL procedure through reliable and accessible telemetry.
